### Hi 

feel free to look around here, or take a look at my website [dfsu.systems](http://dfsu.systems)

take a look at [styxcon](https://styxcon.itch.io), our awesome dev team.

Alternatively, have a proof that there are infinitely many primes:

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\text{Assuming that $\mathbb{P}$ }\text{ is a finite set of all primes} \\
&n = \prod_{x \in \mathbb{P}}^{} x \quad \text{ and } \quad p = n+1 \\
&\forall k  \in \mathbb{P} \quad n \equiv 0 \pmod{k} \quad \text{ and } \quad p \equiv 1 \pmod{k} \\
&\therefore p \text{ has prime factors not in } \mathbb{P} \text{ and therefore, } \\
&\text{the set of primes is not finite.}
\end{aligned}
$$
